### by Ram Thakkar

Hello, my name is *Ram Thakkar* and I am a student in my penultimate year at the University of Auckland! 
I currently study a **Bachelor of Science majoring in Data Science**.

I made this repository for my *STATS 220* class and its projects. The class is called Data Technologies, and for our first project, we have been told to make
a Github account and a repository for the class.

Last year, I did 8 courses. In order from my best to worst performance, here are the courses I did:
1. COMPSCI 120
2. COMPSCI 101
3. STATS 101
4. STATS 125
5. COMPSCI 110
6. COMPSCI 130
7. MATHS 120
8. MATHS 130

For this year, these are my courses for Semester 1:
* STATS 220
* STATS 201
* COMPSCI 220
* COMPSCI 225

And these are my courses for Semester 2:
* STATS 210
* STATS 240
* MATHS 208
* BUSAN 100G

A random and unrelated fun fact about me, I currently hold the **Indian National Record** for the 2x2 Rubik's Cube. I also run a YouTube channel
on the Rubik's Cube, which is New Zealand's biggest cubing channel. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/@RamThakkar) to look at my channel!

Thank you for reading my STATS 220 repository!
